# NetworkY

NetworkY is a library of graph algorithms in Python. It is an extension of the [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx). It contains (by import) everything that is in NetworkX, plus some additional algorithms that were submitted into NetworkX but not merged yet. Currently, NetworkY contains the following additional algorithms:

* [Rank-maximal matching](networky/algorithms/bipartite/rank_maximal_matching.py)
* [Approximate coalition formation](networky/algorithms/approximation/coalition_formation.py)

New additions are welcome!
